    Chapter 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
    
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables 
    systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly 
    programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access 
    data and use it to learn for themselves.
    
    Types of Machine Learning:
    
    1. Supervised Learning
    Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output 
    variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from 
    the input to the output. It is called supervised learning because the 
    process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought 
    of as a teacher supervising the learning process.
    
    2. Unsupervised Learning
    Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no 
    corresponding output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to 
    model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to 
    learn more about the data.
    
    3. Reinforcement Learning
    Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how 
    software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to 
    maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
    
    Applications of Machine Learning:
    - Image and speech recognition
    - Medical diagnosis
    - Financial modeling
    - Recommendation systems
    - Autonomous vehicles
    
    This document serves as a test for our document processing pipeline.
