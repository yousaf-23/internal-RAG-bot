    Introduction to Vector Databases and Semantic Search
    
    Vector databases like Pinecone are revolutionizing how we store and search 
    information. Unlike traditional databases that rely on exact matches or 
    keyword searches, vector databases use mathematical representations called 
    embeddings to understand the meaning and context of data.
    
    How Vector Search Works:
    
    1. Text Embedding: Each piece of text is converted into a high-dimensional 
    vector (typically 1536 dimensions for OpenAI models). These vectors capture 
    the semantic meaning of the text.
    
    2. Similarity Calculation: When searching, the query is also converted to a 
    vector. The database then finds vectors that are closest to the query vector 
    using metrics like cosine similarity.
    
    3. Contextual Understanding: This approach allows the system to find relevant 
    information even when the exact words don't match. For example, searching for 
    "car" might also return results about "automobile" or "vehicle".
    
    Benefits of Vector Databases:
    
    - Semantic Search: Find information based on meaning, not just keywords
    - Scalability: Efficiently search millions or billions of vectors
    - Real-time Performance: Get results in milliseconds
    - Flexibility: Works with any type of data that can be embedded
    
    Use Cases:
    
    - Question Answering: Find relevant passages to answer user queries
    - Recommendation Systems: Find similar products, articles, or content
    - Duplicate Detection: Identify similar or duplicate content
    - Knowledge Management: Organize and retrieve company information
