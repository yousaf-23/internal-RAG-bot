    Introduction to RAG Systems
    
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models 
    with the precision of information retrieval. This approach allows AI systems to 
    provide accurate, contextual responses based on specific documents rather than 
    general training data.
    
    Key Benefits:
    1. Accuracy: Responses are grounded in your actual documents
    2. Traceability: Every answer can be traced back to source documents
    3. Privacy: Your documents stay in your control
    4. Customization: The system learns from YOUR specific knowledge base
    
    How It Works:
    - Documents are processed and split into chunks
    - Each chunk is converted to a mathematical representation (embedding)
    - When you ask a question, it finds the most relevant chunks
    - These chunks provide context for generating accurate answers
    
    This demonstration shows how all components work together seamlessly.
